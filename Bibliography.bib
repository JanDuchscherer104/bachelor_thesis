Chapter 6 assumed that we knew the signal directions and the various spatial spectral matrices (Sx or Sn). In actual applications, we must estimate these quantities (or appropriate surrogates) from the incoming data. The resulting beamformers will adapt to the incoming data and are referred to as adaptive beamformers. This chapter develops the theory and practice of adaptive beamformers.}

abstract = {Abstract A deep-learning-based approach to estimating the number of coherent sources in radar is presented. A proper estimate of the number of sources in a signal enables improved angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation common in applications such as radar, sonar, and communication systems. Many AoA estimators utilised in these areas require accurate estimates of the number of sources for enhanced performance. Herein, a robust method that performs well under the existence of coherent sources is developed. The proposed method is based on deep learning and it is shown to perform better than state-of-the-art versions of the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), Minimum Description Length (MDL), and Exponentially Embedded Families (EEF) estimators, which employ spatial smoothing of the covariance matrix to handle coherent signals.},

%*********************************************************************************************%
%
% This section provides a quick guide on different citation types using biblatex:
%
% 1. Basic Citation:
%    - Command: \cite{key}
%    - Function: Inserts a reference to the work identified by the key.
%    - Example: \cite{sampleArticle}
%
% 2. Author-Year Citation:
%    - Command: \textcite{key}
%    - Function: Inserts the author(s) and the year of the work identified by the key.
%    - Example: \textcite{sampleArticle}
%
% 3. Author-Only and Year-Only:
%    - Commands:
%        \citeauthor{key}  % Prints the author's name(s)
%        \citeyear{key}    % Prints the year of publication
%    - Example:
%        \citeauthor{sampleArticle}
%        \citeyear{sampleArticle}
%
% 4. Multiple Citations:
%    - Command: \cite{key1,key2,key3}
%    - Function: Allows citing multiple works at once.
%    - Example: \cite{sampleArticle,sampleBook,sampleConference}
%
% Note: Replace 'key', 'key1', 'key2', 'key3' with the respective citation keys from your .bib file.
