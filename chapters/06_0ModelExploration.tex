\chapter{Model Exploration}
\label{ch:model_exploration}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter aims to outline the exploration of the inspected model and hyperparameter space.
The selection of the most appropriate form of input data forms the cornerstone of this exploratory process.
Subsequently, the chapter delves into the potential preprocessing steps that can be applied to the input data to increase
its suitability as input to \glspl{dnn}.\\
The chapter then extends to the architectural design choices of the models. The considered architectures are
variations of the classical dense, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks.
The \gls{cnn} and \gls{rnn} based models will be explored in more detail than the \gls{mlp} architecture, as they provide
each provide unique advantages for the task at hand, whereas the \gls{mlp} mostly serves as a baseline model.\\
A comparative analysis of the different model architectures among themselves and with the previously introduced algorithms
will then be conducted in~\autoref{ch:evaluation_results}.
